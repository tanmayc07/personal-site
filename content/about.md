> “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” ―Aristotle

I'm a computer programmer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science from SUNY Binghamton University. Previously I completed
my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai. 

A versatile software developer driven by the pursuit of engineering elegant solutions, I easily transition between technologies to deliver superior, results-oriented user experiences.
