> “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” ―Aristotle

I'm a computer programmer currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science from SUNY Binghamton University. Previously I completed
my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from University of Mumbai. 

I'm passionate about building software programs and dabbling with new technologies to create user-focused and result-driven applications.
